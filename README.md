## Future Development

The following features are slated for upcoming development - the actual order of implementation may vary from this list's order.
If you would like to contribute or have an idea/modification, please contact the contributors of this application.

### Better State Management -- 
Currently page reloads are used to force new database queries. Updating state management to reduce the need for page reloads

### Validate against duplicate usernames

### Add logic to update due-dates -- 
Right now, "Due Date" is  a static field, and we'd like for it to update dynamically monthly or annual depending on the style of subscription

### Improved Dark Mode --  
Dark mode currently effects some but not all elements

### Sort By due Date on Welcome page and Only Show Upcoming Expenses -- 
Hide due dates that are >31 days in future

### Budget Tips -- 
Utilize free API service to populate the user dashboard with randomized budgeting/financial advice
